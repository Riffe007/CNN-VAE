# CNN-VAE
Convolutional Neural Network - Variational AutoEncoder
#**CNN-VAE**
This is a Tensorflow implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with a variational autoencoder (VAE) for unsupervised feature learning. The CNN is trained to extract features from images, while the VAE is trained to learn a compact latent representation of the images.

#**Dependencies**
The code requires Tensorflow and Keras to be installed, as well as other standard data science libraries such as numpy and matplotlib.

#**Installation**
To install the CNN-VAE, simply clone the repository and install the dependencies. The code is written in Python and should work on any platform that supports Tensorflow and Keras.

#**Usage**
The CNN-VAE can be trained on your own dataset by providing the path to the dataset in the appropriate configuration file. Once trained, the CNN-VAE can be used for a wide range of computer vision tasks, such as image classification, image generation and anomaly detection. The provided code provide a command-line interface, which allows you to easily train the CNN-VAE on new inputs, as well as perform other tasks, such as evaluation and visualizing results.

#**Datasets**
Currently, this implementation is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, but it can easily be adapted to other datasets as well.

#**Note**
This implementation uses the VAE Loss function and generates latent variable. And also the current implementation is using CIFAR-10 dataset but you can replace the dataset with your own dataset.

#**Support**
If you have any questions or issues regarding the CNN-VAE, please open an issue on the GitHub repository and the development team will be happy to assist you.

#**Contributing**
We welcome any contributions to the CNN-VAE, whether it's in the form of bug reports, feature requests, or code. If you would like to contribute, please see the CONTRIBUTING.md file in the repository for more information.
