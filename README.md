# Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (CNN-VAE)

This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (CNN-VAE), a deep learning model capable of learning complex data distributions for tasks like image generation, data augmentation, anomaly detection, and feature extraction.

## Overview

A Variational Autoencoder is a type of autoencoder that generates a latent, or hidden, representation of its input data. The CNN-VAE specifically uses convolutional layers, making it well-suited for handling image data. It is capable of both reconstructing input images and generating new images that are similar to those it was trained on.

## Features

- Image generation and reconstruction
- Anomaly detection in image datasets
- Feature extraction from high-dimensional data
- Dimensionality reduction

## Installation

To use the CNN-VAE, you will need Python installed on your machine. Additionally, the project depends on several Python libraries, such as Keras and NumPy.

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Riffe007/CNN-VAE.git
cd CNN-VAE
